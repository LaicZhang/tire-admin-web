- Any suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

### Response / Fix SLA (best-effort)

- Acknowledgement: within 2 business days
- Triage/update: within 5 business days

## Supported Versions

We provide security fixes for the latest released version of each component. Older versions may not receive backports; upgrading to the latest release is recommended.
