## Introduction

This project is an inventory management application for the tire trading industry. It was developed using the Vue family (Vue 3, Vite, Pinia, VueUse), a self-encapsulated UI component library based on Element-plus, the Echarts 5 data visualization library, the Axios network request library, and TypeScript 5. The project's goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing product inventory and sales, as well as a login function. Features to be developed include: optimizing data visualization, Redis caching, log management, file management, push settings management, and deleting users and related data.

The project currently supports version 1.x.x; versions below 1.0 will no longer receive security updates.
